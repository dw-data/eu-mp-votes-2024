For this story, we looked at how the hard-right groups in the European parliament â€“ Identity and Democracy (ID) and European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) voted on major EU issues. 
We identified a dataset of 19 votes on four major topics:

- **Enlargement and integration:** This reflects attitudes towards EU candidate countries and general EU collaboration.
- **Green Deal:** Five votes on the major components of recent EU environmental regulations summarized in the [European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)
- **Migration package:** Five votes that formed the components of the EU's [Pact on Migration and Asylum](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-asylum/pact-migration-and-asylum_en)
